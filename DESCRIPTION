Description: Provides tools to download comprehensive datasets of local, 
    state, and federal election results in Germany from 1990 to 2025. The package 
    facilitates access to data on turnout, vote shares for major parties, and 
    demographic information across different levels of government (municipal, state, 
    and federal). It offers access to geographically harmonized datasets 
    that account for changes in municipal boundaries over time and incorporate 
    mail-in voting districts. Users can easily retrieve, clean, and standardize 
    German electoral data, making it ready for analysis. Data is sourced from 
    <https://www.german-elections.com>.
