Description: Provides tools to download comprehensive datasets of local,
    state, and federal election results in Germany from 1990 to 2025. The package
    facilitates access to data on turnout, vote shares for major parties, and
    demographic information across different levels of government (municipal, state,
    and federal). It offers access to geographically harmonized datasets
    that account for changes in municipal boundaries over time and incorporate
    mail-in voting districts. Includes bundled county-level covariates from INKAR,
    municipality-level Census 2022 data, and Bundeswahlleiter structural data.
    Users can easily retrieve, clean, and standardize German electoral data,
    making it ready for analysis. Data is sourced from
    <https://github.com/awiedem/german_election_data>.
