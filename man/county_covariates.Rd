\description{
A dataset containing county-level socioeconomic and demographic indicators for 400 German counties
from 1995 to 2022. Data are from INKAR (Indikatoren und Karten zur Raum- und Stadtentwicklung),
provided by the Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (BBSR).

This dataset is designed to be merged with GERDA election data. County codes are formatted
to match GERDA's 5-digit county codes. Use a left join with GERDA data to automatically
retain only election years.
}
\details{
\subsection{Data Source}{

Data are downloaded from INKAR using the \code{{inkr}} R package:
\itemize{
\item Nguyen HL (2024). {inkr}: Local Access from R to All INKAR Data.
\doi{10.5281/zenodo.7643755}
\item Data provided by: Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (BBSR)
\item License: Data licence Germany – attribution – version 2.0
}
}

\subsection{Missing Data}{

Some variables have missing values, particularly for earlier years:
\itemize{
\item Basic demographics (age, foreign population): Nearly complete
\item Economic indicators: Some missingness in earlier years
\item Income variables: More limited coverage, especially before 2020
}
}

\subsection{Merging with GERDA}{

To merge with GERDA election data, use a left join with GERDA data on the left side.
This automatically keeps only election years:

}
\note{
This dataset is not part of the official GERDA data collection, but is provided
as a convenience for researchers working with German election data. County codes
follow the 2021 boundaries and match GERDA's harmonized county codes.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load GERDA election data
library(gerda)
elections <- load_gerda_web("federal_cty_harm")

# Access covariates (automatically available after loading gerda)
# Option 1: Direct access (with LazyData enabled)
head(county_covariates)

# Option 2: Explicit loading (always works)
data(county_covariates)

# Merge: GERDA left, keeps only election years
library(dplyr)
merged <- elections \%>\%
    left_join(county_covariates,
        by = c("county_code" = "county_code", "election_year" = "year")
    )

# Check result
table(merged$election_year) # Only election years (1998, 2002, 2005, etc.)
